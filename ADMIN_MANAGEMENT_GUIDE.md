# 🦅 AGATE Platform: Administrative Management Guide

This guide is for **Platform Owners** and **Business Administrators** who manage the day-to-day operations of the AI system.

---

## 🚪 1. Accessing the Admin Dashboard

The primary interface for non-developers is the **Admin Dashboard**.

*   **URL**: `http://<your-server-ip>/admin/`
*   **Credentials**: See your System Administrator for your secure username/password.

---

## 📚 2. Knowledge Base Management

To make the AI specialized in your business data, you must manage the "Knowledge Base".

### 📥 Adding New Knowledge
1.  Navigate to the **Knowledge Base** tab in the Dashboard.
2.  Use the **File Uploader** to add PDFs (e.g., Labor Law, Sales Catalog).
3.  Click **Index Document**.
    *   *Note: Large PDFs may take up to 60 seconds to process as they are split into mathematical "vectors".*

### 🔍 Verifying Knowledge
Check the **Indexed Documents** table to confirm which files the AI currently "knows". If a file is in this table, the Legal, HR, and IT agents can reason over it.

## 🤖 3. Using the Specialized Agents

The platform provides dedicated assistants that "think" differently based on their mission:

| Agent | Expertise | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Assistant** | Moroccan Codes, Compliance | Interpreting contracts or labor laws. |
| **HR Assistant** | Company Policies, Benefits | Answering "How many holiday days do I have?" |
| **IT Support** | Infrastructure, Troubleshooting | Helping staff with technical configuration. |

## 👥 4. User & Performance Monitoring

### Monitoring Usage
Under the **System Analytics** tab, you can track:
*   **Volume**: How many questions were asked today.
*   **Cost**: Estimated cloud fallback spending.
*   **Performance**: If "Avg Latency" is high (above 5s), contact IT to scale the server.

### Managing Access
*   Access keys and User IDs are managed in the **User Management** tab.
*   You can deactivate keys instantly if they are compromised.

## 🆘 5. Common Solutions

*   **"The AI is giving generic answers"**: Ensure the specific policy document has been uploaded and indexed.
*   **"Can't Login"**: Reset your JWT token by logging out and logging back in from the sidebar.
*   **"System feels slow"**: This can happen during heavy data ingestion. Wait for the indexing to complete.
